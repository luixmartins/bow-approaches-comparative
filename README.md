# Comparatison between text classification approaches


This repository was created to analyze and test some approaches to classify textual data, such as BoW methods, transformers models, etc. 


- BoW methods:

    * CountVectorizer
    * TfidfVectorizer 

- Transformer models: 

    * bert-base-multilingual-cased in Sentence-Transformers 
    * distilbert-base-multilingual-cased in Sentence-Transformers 

- Proposed models: 

    * TD-Bert with bert-base-multilingual-cased in Sentence-Transformers
    * TD-Bert with distilbert-base-multilingual-cased in Sentence-Transformers

    These methods can be found at [github repository](https://github.com/ivanfilhoreis/td_bert)
